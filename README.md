# **Cardano EZ-Installer**

A quick and easy way to install `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` using Nix.

## **Installation**

- This installer can only be used with Unix-like operating systems (Linux, MacOS, WSL). Windows is not supported.
- See the `Minimum System Requirements` for the particular release of `cardano-node` you're installing on the **[releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)** page (the release the installer uses is set with the `NODE_RELEASE` variable in the `.env` file).
- The `nix` package manager is required for installation. Instructions for installing and configuring Nix are provided below.
- This installer configures `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` to work with the following terminal shells:
  - `bash` (Linux & MacOS)
  - `zsh` (MacOS)

  The installer configures the node and cli to work with MacOS in both login and interactive shells.
  
  If you wish to use a different shell you'll need to manually configure the necessary aliases and `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` export in the associated dotfile.

1. **Install `nix`**

- If you're setting up Nix on your system for the first time, try Determinate Systems' **[Zero-to-Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com)** in lieu of the official installer, as it provides an easier tool for **[installing](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install)** and **[uninstalling](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/uninstall)** Nix.
- Alternatively, you may follow the instructions for **multi-user installation** for your OS at **[nixos.org](https://nixos.org/download.html)**. This approach will require some additional configuration and it will be harder to uninstall Nix should you need to. It is only recommended if you've previously installed Nix on your system, as it will detect and repair a previous installation as needed.
- When you are finished installing Nix, close the terminal session and open a fresh one.

2. **Configure `nix.conf`**

- Edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf`: this requires root access to edit. Use a terminal-based editor like `nano` (i.e.):

  ```sh
  sudo nano /etc/nix/nix.conf
  ```

- Modify the file following the instructions below:

  ```
  # Sample /etc/nix/nix.conf

  # Step 2a: Add this line to enable Flakes if missing (if you used the Zero-to-Nix installer this should already be added)
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes

  # Step 2b: Add your username to trusted-users (also include 'root' to prevent overriding default setting)
  trusted-users = root your-username
  ```

  **ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT!** You must restart the `nix-daemon` to apply the changes

  **Linux:**

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon
  ```

  **MacOS:**

  ```sh
  sudo launchctl stop org.nixos.nix-daemon
  sudo launchctl start org.nixos.nix-daemon
  ```

3. **Clone and configure**

- Clone this repository on your system.
- Open `cardano-ez-installer/.env` in any text editor and adjust the environment variables according to your preference.

  > By default the installer is configured to save the necessary files to `~/cardano` and `~/cardano-src` directories.

  ```sh
    # .env

    export NODE_RELEASE="8.0.0" # Replace with newer version and re-run the script to update your installation
    export CARDANO_SRC_PATH="$HOME/cardano-src" # Where cardano-node source files will be saved
    export CARDANO_PATH="$HOME/cardano" # Where node database and config files will be saved
  ```

4. **Run `cardano-ez-installer`**

- Open a terminal window and enter the `cardano-ez-installer` directory.
- Run `./install.sh` to start the installation.
- The installation may take a long time, especially with a fresh install, so be patient! The EZ-Installer doesn't display output information while `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` are building, to make the installation process easier to follow. If the installer is taking a while on a particular step but you don't see any errors, assume that the installation is proceeding successfully.
- If you encounter any errors during the installation process, return to the `README` and follow the instructions to resolve them. Then run `./install.sh` again.

5. **Start your node**

- Once the installation completes, you can start `cardano-node` from a new terminal window using any of the following aliases:
  - `preprod-node` for preprod testnet
  - `preview-node` for preview testnet
  - `main-node` for mainnet
  
- When you are finished using the node, make sure to properly close the node connection by typing `CTRL + c` in the terminal session where it's running. 

  >**NOTE:** If you close the terminal without doing this, the socket will remain open and you won't be able to start the node again unless you manually kill the associated process or restart your system!

## **Using `cardano-cli`**
**[Cardano CLI Guru](https://github.com/iburzynski/cardano-cli-guru)** is a companion project that provides numerous conveniences for working with `cardano-cli`, including:
* Many pre-written utility scripts to easily execute common `cardano-cli` commands
* Management of local environment variables via `direnv`, making it easy to switch networks and manage file inputs/outputs without polluting your dotfiles (like `~/.bashrc`) with additional variables
* A guided tutorial to teach you how to construct and submit various types of transactions

If you don't want to use the Guru, you can follow the instructions below to use `cardano-cli`. This will require setting the `CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID` environment variable manually, as well as writing more verbose commands.

1. Start the node using the alias for the network you're working with.
  * Allow the node a little time to boot up and start synchronizing before proceeding.
  * It's normal for the node to encounter occasional errors, which it will recover from and continue running. To tell if your node is working properly, look for `Chain extended` log entries with the following format:

    ```sh
    Chain extended, new tip: c472036b83c119b875e3fc230435b741598677ffa45ea3ad8ad9cda3f70a872d at slot 12227931
    ```

2. Open a new terminal window. You'll need to set the `CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID` variable in this terminal session to tell `cardano-cli` which network you're using.

  * For `preprod` testnet:

    ```sh
    CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID=1
    ```

  * For `preview` testnet:

    ```sh
    CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID=2
    ```

  * For `mainnet`:

    ```sh
    CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID=mainnet
    ```

    >**NOTE:** If you intend to primarily use a single network and don't want to set this variable every time you use `cardano-cli`, you can export this variable in the appropriate dotfile (`~/.bashrc` for Linux, `~/.bash_profile`/`~/.zprofile` for MacOS in login shell sessions, `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` for MacOS in interactive shell sessions), for example:

    ```sh
    # ~./bashrc

    # add this to use preprod testnet:
    export CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID=1
    ```

  * Once the `CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID` variable is set, you'll be able to run any `cardano-cli` command and interact with your running node.

3. Run the `cardano-cli query tip` command and wait for sync.
  * This will confirm that your node and `cardano-cli` are working properly and show the synchronization progress.
  * You should see output informing you of the current slot number and the percentage that your node is synced.

    ```sh
    $ cardano-cli query tip
    
    {
        "block": 546242,
        "epoch": 141,
        "era": "Babbage",
        "hash": "7ee471e26ed927ae463d386cdd322fd7f3afb18d0fef462255ce2a2f221d7112",
        "slot": 12227857,
        "syncProgress": "100.00"
    }
    ```
  * Once your node is 100% synced you can begin using other `cardano-cli` commands to interact with the blockchain.

  >**NOTE:** when you're finished, remember to close the node connection by typing `CTRL + c` in the terminal session where it's running.

## **Updating `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli`**

Updating `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` is simple:

- Change the version number for the `NODE_RELEASE` variable in `.env`.
- Run `./install.sh` to update.
